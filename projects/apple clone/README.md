hey everyone. I am a rookie web developer.
recently after learning a some CSS i gave myself a little self-project - to replicate the apple india website (for educational purposes only)
i tried doing the same and here is my attempt.
it is not at all a cut to cut copy, but since i am still learning i aimed to utilise what i know :)
there is no use of javascript.
in the future i intend to make this size more reactive and add some cool features.
nevertheless it was fun making this.
cheers!
