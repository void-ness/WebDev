this was my first full fledged project related to web development as part of the web dev course i was learning from.
tried replicating the front end look of flipkart.com
i had just learned CSS so the results are not too good but hey! it was my first attempt huh :)
thanks a lot for sparing your time and reading this.
i loved using the hover effect the most and also using unsplash api to insert random images into my website.
peace :)
